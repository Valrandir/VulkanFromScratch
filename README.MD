# Vulkan From Scratch
## What this is
Vulkan From Scratch is a guide about learning how to create a vulkan game from scratch.
The goal is to use as few existing libraries as reasonable, in order to learn how everything is working.
Note that this is about learning vulkan and 3D, not about learning compression algorithms, complex image and music formats.

## Why?
Most information make use of many existing libraries, preventing one from truly learning how to build a vulkan application.
Writing this guide will allow the author to share what he learns with others, who are also inclined.

## What this is not
This is not a recommended guide to get quick results with minimal time and effort.
If your goal is to deliver a game in a reasonable timeframe, use an existing engine.
