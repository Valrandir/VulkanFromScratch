# Where does things comes from 
## On Windows 10 

From the Khronos Vulkan headers comes
	vulkan_core.h

Those functions are implemented in the vulkan loader
	C:\Windows\System32\vulkan-1.dll

They can optionally be loaded by using the vulkan-1.lib provided with the Khronos vulkan tools

Or the Lunar SDK can be installed, including many demos and tools.
